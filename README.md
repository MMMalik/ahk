## Intro

Windows 10 + WSL 2 has recently become my setup of choice. This repo hosts some scripts that I use to facilitate day-to-day tasks.

## Getting started

Add `keyboard.ahk` script to Autostart. Use `F1` to open GUI. Select profile config from the dropdown and enter project name in the input field (project name is the same as folder name).

## Scripts

### `keyboard.ahk`

Contains custom keyboard shortcuts.

### `code.ahk`

GUI for selecting VS Code projects. Opens VS Code and Windows Terminal with predefined profiles: Powershell for Windows projects and Ubuntu for WSL projects. Config is specified in `config.ahk` file.
